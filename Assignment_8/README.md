## Model Architecture

The implementation uses ResNet18 architecture with the following modifications for CIFAR-100:
- Initial convolution layer uses 3×3 kernels with stride 1 (instead of 7×7 with stride 2)
- No initial max pooling layer
- Final average pooling adjusted for CIFAR-100's 32×32 input size
- Output layer modified for 100 classes
